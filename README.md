# Impact-of-AI-ChatGPT-on-daily-returns-of-stocks-of-tech-vs-non-tech-companies
In this study, Difference in Difference method is used to determine the impact of AI dominance 
(ChatGPT launch) on the daily returns on stocks of tech companies from 2021 to 2024. The 
treatment group in this study are the tech companies affected by the release of ChatGPT and control 
group being non-tech companies. The tech companies considered include Google (GOOG), 
Facebook (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and the non-tech companies are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), 
McDonalds (MCD) and Shell PLC (SHEL). 

The Difference in Differences (DiD) method is a quasi-experimental research design used to 
estimate causal effects by comparing changes in outcomes over time between a treatment group 
and a control group.

From the DiD analysis, there is a 0.29% increase in the daily returns of tech companies thus 
Google, META, and Microsoft compared to non-tech companies including Shell PLC, Johnson & 
Johnson, and McDonalds after the launch of Chat GPT on November 30, 2022. And pooled models 
demonstrated strong statistical significance compared to fixed effect models.
